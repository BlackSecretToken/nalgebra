// XXX: those traits should not exist since there is generalized operator overloading of Add and
// Sub.
// However, using the same trait multiple time as a trait bound (ex: impl<T:Â Add<N, V> + Add<V, V>)
// does not work properly, mainly because the way we are doing generalized operator overloading is
// verry hacky.
//
// Hopefull, this will be fixed on the future.
