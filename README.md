nalgebra
========

nalgebra is a n-dimensional linear algebra library written with the rust
programming language.


It is mainly focused on features needed for real-time physics. It should be
usable for graphics too.

## Compilation
You will need the last rust compiler from the incomming branch.
I pull the compiler and fix my code almost every days. If you encounter
problems, make sure you have the last version.

    git clone git://github.com/sebcrozet/nalgebra.git
    cd nalgebra
    make
