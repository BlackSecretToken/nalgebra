# Change Log
All notable changes to `nalgebra`, starting with the version 0.6.0 will be
documented in this file (sorry I didn't maintain one before).

This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [unreleased] [0.6.0]
### Added
  * Dependency to [generic-array](https://crates.io/crates/generic-array)
  * Staticly sized vectors with user-defined sizes: `VecN`.
  * Similarity transformations (an uniform scale followed by a rotation followed
    by a translation): `Sim2`, `Sim3`.

### Removed
  * Zero-sized elements `Vec0`, `Pnt0`.
  * Incomplete 4-dimensional transformations `Rot4` and `Iso4`.

### Modified
  * Vectors are now multipliable Ã  isometries. This will result into a pure rotation (this is how
  vectors differ from point semantically: they design directions so they are not translatable).
