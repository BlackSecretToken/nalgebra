# Change Log
All notable changes to `nalgebra`, starting with the version 0.6.0 will be

This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [0.6.0] - 2016-03-24
### Added
  * Dependency to [generic-array](https://crates.io/crates/generic-array)
  * Staticly sized vectors with user-defined sizes: `VecN`.
  * Similarity transformations (an uniform scale followed by a rotation followed
    by a translation): `Sim2`, `Sim3`.

### Removed
  * Zero-sized elements `Vec0`, `Pnt0`.
  * Incomplete 4-dimensional transformations `Rot4` and `Iso4`.
